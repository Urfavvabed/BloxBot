This race is strong in almost every aspect, except for its relatively weak armor support. you can get this race by having 100 ectoplasms and a hellfire torch that you get from cursed captain",

    "what is cyborg race": "Cyborg is one of two races that can be obtained through a quest.This race's special abilities allow the player to fight and combo more effectively in close quarters, by disabling Instinct or by dealing extra damage and increasing their own defense. This race is mostly used against teamers due to its ability to deal extremely effective wide-area damage. In general, this race is great for grinding, PvP against Teamers and especially breaking combos. Additionally, it is also good for Instinct-Breaking and doing combos with Instinct-Trickable attacks. This race is only weak when the player cannot deal any damage to enemies while having the V3 ability and V4.",
    "what is human race": "Human is one of the four races that players can spawn with on joining the game for the first time. It has a 62.5% chance to be granted upon first joining the game, making it the most common race obtainable through this method.This race mainly supports damage and a bit of mobility. Due to high damage increases, Human can assist the player greatly when they wish to perform one-shot combos. Unlike the Ghoul race, this race can improve the amount of damage it brings.

    "what is shark race": "Shark is one of the four races that players can spawn with upon joining the game for the first time.

Shark is extremely strong against one-shot combos; however, mobility and damage are both lacking in comparison to other races.",
    "what is angel race": "Angel is one of the four races that players can spawn with upon joining the game for the first time. It has a 12.5% chance to be granted upon first joining    This race largely relies on its potential to delay time in battles, providing the player with common abilities such as healing and improved jumping capabilities. The aforementioned buffs are considered by many to be easy to counter, but in return, its V4 can be effective against all races, not purely because of its powerful abilities, but thanks to the ability to break combos (this makes it even more dangerous when the player just needs to fly a long distance and then heal) and the huge damage it is capable of dealing. In general, this race is only dangerous when V4 is activated, and it is recommended to run away/avoid fighting if it is not available (or when at low health). The player should make sure to fill their transformation meter as quickly as possible, especially prior to engaging in PvP.",
    "what is mink race": "Rabbit is one of the four races that players can spawn with upon joining the game for the first time.

This race can be annoying to play against because the Race Awakening's Whirlwind ability has the potential to make people stuck, allowing them to be comboed. However, the increased speed that Rabbit grants when having V4 can be considered excessive when some other races also have similar buffs but have other powerful abilities.",

    "what is rocket": "Rocket is the cheapest fruit in the game, with the same cost that Kilo had. However, its attacks are more powerful and better for grinding and (perhaps) PvP due to the skills' decent AoE. Not to mention, it's also affordable for starters.",
    "what is spin": "Spin is the second cheapest fruit and is not recommended for use due to its poor performance in both grinding and PvP due to the fact that it only has 4 moves, with only 1 of these being a ranged attack. Many other fruits are better for grinding and PvP alike.",
    "what is chop": "Chop gains value through its passive immunity to sword damage even if they are imbued with Aura, making the user incredibly powerful against those who mainly use swords when it comes to PvP.

However, it is recommended to use other fruits for grinding in Second and Third Sea due to a lack of mobility.",
    "what is smoke": "Smoke is a Common Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 100,000 or RobuxIcon 250 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Despite its low cost and the fact that it is a Common fruit, Smoke is regarded as a good fruit as it excels in First Sea grinding and low level PvP as it has multiple stunning attacks, deals good damage for a common Blox Fruit, and can deal infinite damage using the F ability, 'Smoke Bomber'.",
    "what is spike": "Spike is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 180,000 or RobuxIcon 380 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Spike is not recommended for PvP due to its lack of mobility and combos. It is recommended to use better fruits, such as Elemental fruits like Smoke or Flame. However, it is recommended for grinding in the early First Sea, as its moves are AoE.",
    "what is flame": "Flame is an Uncommon Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 250,000 or RobuxIcon 550 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Flame is generally seen as an overall good fruit, due to its Elemental Reflex passive and great AoE making it a great choice for PvP due to its high range, good damage, and ability to break Instinct. Overall, it is a good pick for grinding in First Sea and early Second Sea, and remains viable for PvP in every sea.",
    "what is ice": "Ice is an Uncommon Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 350,000 or RobuxIcon 750 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Ice is famously known for its great abilities and capacity for Bounty Hunting, grinding, great stuns, moderate damage, and its passive Frost Walker. Ice is an ideal fruit for new bounty hunters as the stuns are easy to land, which can trap players in an inescapable combos (meaning they can’t Instinct dodge it), it can also counter fruits like Buddha, because of the long and big AoE that the stuns bring. This fruit also has M1s (left-clicks), making it a lot easier to grind in the First Sea and early Second Sea.",
    "what is falcon": "Falcon (formerly known as 'Bird: Falcon') is an Uncommon Beast-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 300,000 or RobuxIcon 650 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.alcon is generally known as one of the worst fruits in the game, as it only has 3 attack moves, all of which deal mediocre damage and lack AoE.",
    "what is dark": "Dark is an Uncommon Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 500,000 or RobuxIcon 950 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Dark is considered a great Blox Fruit for PvP when awakened due to its long stuns and teleport move, allowing the ease of Sword and Gun combos if they are fully invested in it instead of Blox Fruit.",
    "what is sand": "Sand is an Uncommon Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 420,000 or RobuxIcon 850 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.The unawakened version of Sand is not very good for PvP, but can be decent for grinding since it is an Elemental fruit. However, the awakened version of Sand excels in the moves’ hitboxes, damage, speed, stun, and versatility. Overall, it’s an amazing fruit for PvP and bounty hunting when awakened, and it's decent for grinding despite its low price.",
    "what is diamond": "Diamond is an Uncommon Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 600,000 or RobuxIcon 1,000 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Although Diamond is rarely used in PvP, it can be useful for Sword mains as it provides a valuable defense boost without any hitbox increases (unlike Buddha).

    "what is rubber": "Rubber is a Rare Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 750,000 or RobuxIcon 1,200 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Rubber turns its user's body into rubber, and grants the user immunity to Rumble, Electric, and Guns. However, it does not grant immunity to Electric Claw, Pole (1st Form) and Pole (2nd Form), even though they are electric-based forms of attack. Rubber is good for grinding because of its long ranged M1s.Rubber is good until the player reaches Upper Skylands since most NPCs have ranged attacks and the fruit needs a lot of accuracy. It is still, to a degree, a better option for grinding, than most 'regular' Blox Fruits.",
    "what is light": "Light is a Rare Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 650,000 or RobuxIcon 1,100 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Light is considered to be one of the best grinding fruits in First Sea since it is an Elemental Blox Fruit and has AoE moves, decent damage, relatively low mastery requirements, M1s, and one of the fastest movement abilities in the game. However, awakened Buddha or awakened Magma are more recommended in the Second Sea and Third Sea, unless the player is experienced with grinding and can awaken this fruit, due to the high level requirements in order to activate Elemental immunity. Its Awakened version is a great choice for PvP due to its good stuns, decent range, good combo potential, and high damage.",
    "what is magma": "Magma is a Rare Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 960,000 or RobuxIcon 1,300 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Magma is known for its high damage output, which means it is considered one of the best Blox Fruits for Sea Events and grinding due to the water walking passive when the player awakens at least one move, and the high damage over time, plus the extremely low cooldown for [Z] Magma Shower. It doesn't require much mastery, meaning First Sea players can grind with the unawakened version of it easily. It is also good for Second Sea and Third Sea as it is excellent for Sea Events like the Leviathan, Sea Beast and Ship Raids. Being the highest damaging fruit allows it to be able to solo easy raids like Flame, Dark, and others. This fruit is currently the most expensive rare fruit in the game.",
    "what is barrier": "Barrier is a Rare Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 800,000 or RobuxIcon 1,250 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Barrier is decent for Raids, since the user can block enemies with [Z] Barrier Wall, letting their teammates damage the NPCs or Bosses without taking damage. However, it can be underwhelming if used elsewhere. This fruit is really useful for trolling as the user can block other player’s path, such as blocking the entrance of Mansion at Floating Turtle, Portal [V] Exit, Cursed Ship, etc. But this fruit is one of the worst fruits for PVP and grinding.",
    "what is ghost": "Ghost (formerly known as Revive) is a Rare Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 940,000 or RobuxIcon 1,275 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Ghost has unique skills controlled from the dead and it gives the user good mobility and a strong passive which is 'Resurrection', which gives the player a second life after dying with half health, meaning that the player can play more offensively as it allows them to survive most of the combos.",
    "what is quake": "Quake is a Legendary Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,000,000 or RobuxIcon 1,500 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Quake allows the user to create powerful shockwaves, which can travel through the air and inflict large amounts of damage.Quake is famous for its huge hitbox, drastic screen shake and stun from its V move. In addition, All of Awakened Quake's moves break Instinct and do medium-high damage. Due to all these factors, Quake is an excellent fruit in PvP/Bounty hunting and boss fighting (when awakened).",
    "what is love": "Love is a Legendary Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,300,000 or RobuxIcon 1,700 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Love is exceptionally used for its specialty in giving enemies debuffs from the passive of the abilities. This fruit focuses on AoE damage moves, with a capacity for support, as it has a flight move that can carry an ally.",
    "what is buddha": "Buddha (formerly known as 'Human: Buddha') is a Legendary Beast-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,200,000 or RobuxIcon 1,650 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Buddha's ability increases the user's fighting style and sword's M1/Melee range makes it one of the best fruits for Raids, PvP, and grinding, where users can use swords, fighting styles and guns when transformed, making the fruit particularly useful for players grinding on melee or sword combat. However, this leads to the drawback of Buddha users not using their moves and only utilizing M1s, making it easy to sky-camp and use ranged attacks to kill a Buddha user.",
    "what is spider": "Spider (formerly known as String) is a Legendary Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,500,000 or RobuxIcon 1,800 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Spider is widely known for its capability in PvP. This fruit is not good for grinding as it lacks Elemental Reflex and its moves may be hard to hit. On the other hand, it is an excellent fruit for PvP when awakened due to its stuns, damage, and hitboxes. To take advantage of the fruit's power, the player must be relatively skilled.",
    "what is sound": "Sound is a Legendary Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,700,000 or RobuxIcon 1,900 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Sound is recognised for dealing AoE damage on every move (disregarding the [F] move). This fruit is widely considered as a great choice for both grinding and PvP. It also has some potential in Sea Beast hunting, as it can provide both a high damage output and valuable support when allied with a group of players.",
    "what is phoenix": "Phoenix (formerly known as Bird: Phoenix) is a Legendary Beast-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,800,000 or RobuxIcon 2,000 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Phoenix can be used to heal or support allies along with the large AoE it brings. In addition, this is also the fruit that consumes the most energy. Phoenix is known to be decently good for sea events because of the awakened [F] move (Swift Flight), making the user able to fly and do small damage over time. Unawakened Phoenix is not recommended for sea events, as only the [Z] move and [C] move can damage them.",
    "what is portal": "Portal (formerly known as Door) is a Legendary Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 1,900,000 or RobuxIcon 2,000 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Portal is famous for its ability to fast-travel. This fruit grants the user the ability to teleport to any island with the [C] ability (except for a few), and can open portals on both land and air. It is known as the best fruit for Fruit Hunting and avoiding Bounty Hunters, and it’s arguably the best fruit for mobility and traveling. It is also frequently used for PvP and combos due to its great potential, as well as the versatility of its [X] and [V] skills. Because of the extremely mobile skills Portal possesses, it can avoid typical stuns like Rumble, Dough and Buddha.",
    "what is rumble": "Rumble is a Legendary Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,100,000 or RobuxIcon 2,100 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Rumble is known as a versatile Blox Fruit for PvP due to its stun, damage, combo potential and movement ability.

    "what is pain": "Pain (formerly known as Paw) is a Legendary Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,300,000 or RobuxIcon 2,200 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Pain is rarely seen in PvP combat, though it possesses a variety of long-ranged moves. Pain is mostly used by sword or gun users and has a low value in trading.",
    "what is blizzard": "Blizzard is a Legendary Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,400,000 or RobuxIcon 2,250 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Blizzard is considered to be one of the most versatile fruits in the game due to its stuns, high damage output, and its PvP potential. This fruit is also one of the best fruits for Sea Events and grinding due to its high AoE damage as well as its flight ability, which allows players to deal damage infinitely without taking damage.",
    "what is gravity": "Gravity is a Mythical Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,500,000 or RobuxIcon 2,300 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Gravity is generally considered difficult to master in PvP but has decent combo potential, stuns and damage. Gravity does not have a lot of value in trading as it is not an exceedingly good fruit. It's not recommended to use this fruit for grinding in any sea due to its high mastery requirements, knockback, and mostly small hitbox.",
    "what is mammoth": "Mammoth is a Mythical Beast-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,700,000 or RobuxIcon 2,350 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Mammoth allows the user to transform into an armored Mammoth.Like the Leopard fruit, Mammoth does not require a fury meter for transformation. While transformed, the user can deal continuous damage by holding [F], and its M1 attack includes a roar that can hit Sea Beasts, making it a moderate choice for hunting Sea Events when using the Shark race.Mammoth is a decent fruit for PvP, since it has a long movement ability when untransformed and an infinitely damaging move when in transformed mode, but it is advised to use other fruits to aid in combat because of its slow movesets",
    "what is trex": "T-Rex is a Mythical Beast-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,700,000 or RobuxIcon 2,350 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.T-Rex allows the user to transform into a Tyrannosaurus Rex, commonly abbreviated as T-Rex.T-Rex has a relatively high demand in trading for its good farming potential, an amazing PvP performance and M1 ability. Although there are no mastery requirements for the tap (M1) move, casual First and early Second Sea players will only have 1-2 skills unlocked due to this fruit's high mastery levels.

    "what is dough": "Dough is a Mythical Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,800,000 or RobuxIcon 2,400 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Dough has incredible PvP potential and moderate grinding capabilities when awakened, having great stuns, Instinct break, and great damage on almost every move, making it simultaneously gain an incredibly high value in trading. It is considered to be one of the hardest Blox Fruits to awaken but also one of the best by the community. Even though it is an Elemental-type Blox Fruit, it is not recommended to use it in First Sea and early Second Sea due to its high mastery requirements and most of the V1 moves being single-target. However, using it simply for its Elemental Reflex can be useful, though alternatives, such as Light are way better.",
    "what is shadow": "Shadow is a Mythical Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,900,000 or RobuxIcon 2,425 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Shadow is a great choice as a PvP fruit due to its high damage output and Umbra.

It requires a lot of mastery which makes it hard to unlock all the moves, especially in the First Sea and early Second Sea.",
    "what is venom": "Venom is a Mythical Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 3,000,000 or RobuxIcon 2,450 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
